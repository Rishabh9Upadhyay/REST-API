# # REST API
A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a web service that allows clients to interact with a server through standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. It operates using stateless communication, meaning each request from a client contains all the information needed for the server to process it. REST APIs are commonly used to enable communication between different systems or software components over the web.
